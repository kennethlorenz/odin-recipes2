        <li>1 pound chopped nuts</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C). Butter the bottoms
          and sides of a 9x13-inch pan.
        </li>
        <li>Chop nuts and toss with cinnamon. Set aside.</li>
        <li>
          Unroll phyllo dough. Cut whole stack in half to fit pan. Cover phyllo
          with a dampened cloth to keep from drying out as you work. Place two
          sheets of dough in pan, butter thoroughly. Repeat until you have 8
          sheets layered.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sprinkle 2 to 3 tablespoons of nut mixture on top. Top with two sheets
          of dough, butter, nuts, layering as you go. The top layer should be
          about 6 to 8 sheets deep.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using a sharp knife cut into diamond or square shapes all the way to
          the bottom of the pan. You may cut into 4 long rows then make diagonal
          cuts. Bake for about 50 minutes until baklava is golden and crisp.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sauce while baklava is baking. Boil sugar and water until sugar
          is melted. Add vanilla and honey. Simmer for about 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove baklava from the oven and immediately spoon sauce over it. Let
          cool.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve in cupcake papers. This freezes well. Leave it uncovered as it
          gets soggy if it is wrapped up.
        </li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
